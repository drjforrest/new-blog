# Agenda 2063: The Digital Transformation of a Continent

When the **African Union adopted Agenda 2063 in 2015**, it recognized that digital transformation would be fundamental to Africa's future. Nearly a decade later, this vision has evolved into a comprehensive framework for harnessing digital technologies, with implications that reach far beyond simple technological advancement. As Africa positions itself in the global digital landscape, this transformation represents not just technological progress, but a reimagining of how a **continent of 1.4 billion people can leverage digital innovation** to address longstanding development challenges.

## From Vision to Framework

The Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa (2020-2030) represents a crucial evolution of Agenda 2063's digital vision. It moves beyond merely acknowledging technology's importance to providing a detailed roadmap for digital innovation and adoption. This strategy emphasizes African ownership of its digital future - a significant shift from previous development paradigms.

What perhaps was not known at the time of writing the Digital Transformation Strategy is that the period of which the plan would cover, may very well end up representing the greatest period of global digital transformation since the adoption of personal computing. To seize this moment and leapfrog into the AI revolution before us, Africans will find comfort and guidance in the policy framework's broad applicability.

## The Five Pillars: Building Blocks of Digital Transformation

The strategy establishes five fundamental pillars that form the foundation of Africa's digital future. Each pillar addresses critical aspects necessary for comprehensive digital transformation while ensuring no one is left behind.

### Pillar 1: Enabling Environment, Policy & Regulation

**Goal:** To create a conducive environment through appropriate policies and regulations that promote digital transformation. This includes fostering political commitment, ensuring policy stability, and promoting a sustainable environment for private sector investment.

**Key activities** include:

- Developing and implementing national, regional, and continental digital strategies
- Creating comprehensive cyberspace policies and legislation
- Establishing data protection and privacy frameworks
- Strengthening collaboration between African institutions and regulators

### Pillar 2: Digital Infrastructure

**Goal:** To facilitate the development of accessible and affordable digital systems, including networks, platforms, and devices. The strategy aims for internet access with a minimum speed of 6 mb/s, costing no more than 1 US cent per MB, accessible through locally manufactured smart devices under \$100.

**Key activities** include:

- Implementing continental digital infrastructure master plans
- Establishing regional integration broadband projects
- Promoting competitive internet interconnection
- Modernizing postal services for digital delivery

### Pillar 3: Digital Skills & Human Capacity

**Goal:** To cultivate a workforce capable of both producing and effectively using digital technologies, ensuring Africa's place in the digital economy.

**Key activities** include:

- Updating education curricula for digital society needs
- Promoting gender-inclusive STEAM education
- Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships for skills development
- Supporting knowledge transfer and mentorship programs

### Pillar 4: Digital Innovation & Entrepreneurship

**Goal:** To foster innovation that aligns with both Sustainable Development Goals and Africa's science and technology strategy.

**Key activities** include:

- Developing supportive legal and regulatory frameworks
- Establishing local digital innovation centers
- Supporting digital entrepreneurs through mentorship
- Promoting locally designed digital solutions

### Pillar 5: Networking

**Goal:** To develop an extended ecosystem and public-private partnerships that create value by attracting and retaining researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors.

**Key activities** include:

- Strengthening collaboration between the private sector, industry associations, and international organizations
- Facilitating knowledge-sharing networks for digital transformation
- Promoting cross-border partnerships to scale digital solutions
- Enhancing data-sharing frameworks to improve AI and digital economy initiatives



## Implementation Progress & Country Leadership


The implementation of digital strategies has revealed a mix of progress and challenges. While some countries and regions have made significant strides in expanding digital infrastructure and investing in skills development, others face persistent barriers to digital inclusion. These disparities highlight the critical role of leadership and coordinated action, particularly in resource allocation and resource-sharing. A deeper exploration of these challenges and opportunities is available in the third article.

Across Africa, several nations stand out as exemplars of digital innovation. For instance, Rwanda has emerged as a model for digital transformation. The country has successfully implemented drone delivery services that deliver critical supplies, like medical essentials and blood, to remote areas. Kenya, on the other hand, has become synonymous with financial inclusion through its mobile money revolution, boasting over 145.8 million active mobile money accounts—the highest in Africa.  

Nigeria’s thriving tech ecosystem is producing innovative solutions to local challenges. Start-ups like Zenith Bank and ALAT are pioneering digital banking solutions, while AI-driven platforms such as Zenvus and Ujuzikilimo are revolutionizing agriculture. Meanwhile, South Africa has established itself as a leader in AI innovation, with initiatives like the Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (PC4RS) and the establishment of cutting-edge centers for data governance and data governance. These efforts are complemented by major investments in telemedicine policies, AI R&D, and international data centers.  



## Realizing the Vision

Now at the strategy's midpoint, several critical questions emerge. How can we ensure digital transformation benefits all Africans, not just those in urban centers or technology hubs? **What role should different stakeholders - governments, private sector, civil society - play in implementing the strategy? And perhaps most pressingly, how can Africa harness the AI revolution to accelerate its development goals?** The answers to these questions will shape not just the success of the Digital Transformation Strategy, but the very nature of African development in the decades to come. 

Africa’s youth population is its greatest asset in the digital age and the true promise for realizing this vision. With **60% of its population under 25**, the continent has the world’s youngest workforce, positioning it as a future hub for innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital transformation. The rapid growth of **youth-led tech startups, digital learning participation, and workforce expansion** highlights how this demographic shift is fueling economic opportunity. Harnessing this potential through **education, investment, and digital inclusion** will be key to unlocking sustainable, technology-driven growth.

As we'll explore in subsequent articles, the promise of technologies like AI represents both unprecedented opportunities for growth and complex challenges that require careful navigation.
